#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs and implement them within a program a scrum plan meeting is done. The team is able to give feedback to the Product owner
based on the requirements from the user requests and can help the Product owner decide whether or not this maybe necessary for the actual project and what
was agreed upon with the client and stakeholders. The user stories helps create actionable items to be listed in sizes and can help create time estimations
and help a team not over or under commit to the amount of work that they can accomplish in one sprint.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach the development of programs by thinking of the problem that I first want to achieve. I break it down into little functions that perhaps are program
needs to work functionally. I hope the agile processes that I will incorporate are that of doing sprints for an amount of work that will be able to help drive a project
forward and show meaningful results in a shorter time frame.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe a good software team member is someone who understands the scope of the project, commits to developing good code that follows a standard perhaps based on what is agreed upon by your team, and is someone who is communicative and of course hardworking.
